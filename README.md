# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
An advanced Face Recognition System which is capable to take attendance of students and employees.

Creating an advance face recognised attendance system using Machine Learning for students or employees.
In this project I basically used Haar-like feature and Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm
where students or employees can marks there attendance by own-self and administrator can access all 
there details by using just a single photo and database.
